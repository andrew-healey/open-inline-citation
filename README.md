To test, run `./make-zips` and install the XPIs in the Zotero Add-ons window, or see [Setting Up a Plugin Development Environment](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/client_coding/plugin_development#setting_up_a_plugin_development_environment) to run from source.

The update manifests are set up to demonstrate upgrading across all versions, but normally a plugin would point to a single update manifest that was updated as new versions were available. The update manifests for versions 1.1 and 1.2 are set up to allow upgrading directly to 2.0 from Zotero 7.
